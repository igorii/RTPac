## Statistical Output

* Identify which information should be reported about real time traffic
* Ensure the necessary information is being captured
* Create (console or GUI?) output that conveys this information
    * What would be really nice is GUI output with the distributions graphed with some graphing library - updated in semi-real time

## Anomaly Detection

* ~~Identify which distributions should be captured~~
    * ~~Currently capturing packet length distribution and destination port distribution~~
* ~~Ensure the necessary information is being captured~~
* ~~Calculate entropy for a given distribution~~
* ~~Ability to compare the entropy of two distributions to find anomalous usage~~
    * ~~Use relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler)~~
* ~~Create baseline distributions~~
* ~~Add capture of windowed traffic~~
* ~~Compare windowed distributions to baseline distributions~~
* output warning (to output GUI preferably)

## Paper

* All of it
